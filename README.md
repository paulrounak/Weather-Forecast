# Weather Forecasting Tool 

## Problem Statement 

Create a command-line tool that accepts a city's name and returns the current weather forecast. Leverage the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and parse it using Python. Your solution should demonstrate how GitHub Copilot can assist with API usage, data parsing, and error handling.

   ```
2. Copy the `weathermap.py` file to your working directory.

### Usage: 
 
1. Open a terminal and run the following command to get weather conditions for a given city:


```python
python weathermap.py <city_name>
```

Example:


```python
python weathermap.py Hawaii
```

### CLI Syntax 

#### Usage: 


```
weathermap.py [-c|-f|-C|-F] <city_name>
```

#### Options: 
 
- `-c`: Get current weather in **metric units** .
 
- `-f`: Get a **5-day forecast**  in **metric units** .
 
- `-C`: Get current weather in **imperial units** .
 
- `-F`: Get a **5-day forecast**  in **imperial units** .
 
- `-h`: Display the help message.

#### Note: 
For city names with spaces, enclose the name in double quotes.
Example: `"Vatican City"`.
